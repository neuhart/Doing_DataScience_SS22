# Project Understanding:

<details><summary> What is the problem, what are the expected benefits? </summary>

* Transhipment, i.e. ship to ship transactions involving goods, personnel etc., is a global phenomenon that often takes places in international waters 

* Good faith actors have no incentive to report their activities and often do not have GOs and NGOs they could report to

* This enables bad actors to hide activities like human rights abuses, tax evasion and supply chain obfuscation
  
</p>
</details>

<details><summary> How would a solution look like? </summary>

* To gain and present an understanding of the underlying mechanisms of transshipment behavior

* To identify patterns in transshipping behavior that enable stakeholders to target only the relevant sub-samples for further analysis and action

</details>

<details><summary> What is known about the domain? </summary>

* The original research paper that created the dataset, the kaggle description and further research by our own team (readme and data description)

# Data Understanding:

<details><summary> What data is available? </summary>

* A dataset featuring pre-identified encounter events between larger vessels( > 300 GT) related to the fishing industry

* A similar dataset featuring loitering events of a single larger vessel related to the fishing industry, but no other vessels with active AIS systems nearby

* A list of transshipment capable vessels and a list of their respective features(flag etc...) 
  
 </details>

<details><summary> Is it relevant to the problem at hand? </summary>

* Highly: We have the geographic distribution, time intervals, timestamps of events and additional features at the transshipment vessel level 
  
   </details>

<details><summary> Is it valid, does it reflect our expectations? </summary>

* The dataset complies with its description, including metadata, the original research is published and peer reviewed and also external sources
  
   </details>

<details><summary> Is the data quality, quantity and recency sufficient? </summary>

* There are some slight issues with data quality that can be easily alleviated via standard methods

* Data quantity is well beyond the need of most standard approaches

* Recency will require some further investigation during evaluation

  - While the data is from within the last decade, there could be some shifts in behavior during the 5 years included in the datasets

  - We do however include time related data in our models to counter this issue early on
  
   </details>

# Data Preparation:

## Data Cleaning

<details><summary> Removing invalid values </summary>
  
  - Remove the tuples whose wrong mmsi format (must be 8-digit number)
  - Remove all tuples whose null values
  - Remove duplicates
    </details>
    
 <details><summary> Detect and Remove Outliers </summary>
  
  * **encounter-events**
    - duration_hr: remove encouters lasted > 65h (96.7% remain)
    - median_distance: 5.282% of data whose median distance equals 0 (have not yet decided to remove or not)
  
  * **loitering-events**
    - loitering_duration: remove 1% of the data whose loitering event longer than 200 hours 
  
  * **transshipment_vessels**
    - Unchanged
   </details>   
   
  <details><summary> Change data format </summary>
  
  - Change the format of start_time and end_time from object to datetime
  - 
    </details>
    

    
## Data Transformation
* **New features**
  * Calculate the distance of each transshipment to the nearest coast
  * Calculate the mean of longitude and latitude during the event 
  
* **Merge dataset**
  * Merges the aggregated datasets with the vessel data on the key pair 'transshipment_vessel_mmsi' and 'mmsi'

* ...
